# Jubilant Potato - AI Utilities Collection

Welcome to the Jubilant Potato project! This repository is a curated collection of Artificial Intelligence utilities designed to be easy to use, replicate, and serve as a playground for testing innovative AI tools.

Our goal is to automate repetitive tasks and provide a set of tools that can be leveraged for various AI-related activities.

## Example Tools

- **Agents**: Implementations of intelligent agents that can perform tasks autonomously.
- **Chatbots**: Conversational agents powered by natural language processing to simulate human-like interactions.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Tools that combine retrieval and generation capabilities for enhanced language understanding and creation.
- **Image Generation**: Utilities that leverage deep learning to generate images from textual descriptions or modify existing images.
